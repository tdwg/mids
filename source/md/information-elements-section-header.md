MIDS defines the information required at each level of digitisation and structures the information into individual elements. In order to measure the level of digitisation of collections where information may be captured in many different database fields and mapped to many different TDWG Standards terms, a construct is needed which groups related fields into a structured framework so that the presence of data can be calculated. This construct is the MIDS Information Element.
