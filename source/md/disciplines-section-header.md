The MIDS task group currently recognises three disciplines for specimen data to enable different digitisation priorities to be accepted for different collections: Biology, Geology, Paleontology. Each discipline has a schema for the information elements, defining at which level each element is required. Each discipline also has mapping schemas, requiring datasets to be allocated to a schema for calculation to be undertaken.
