**Abstract**
: Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) is a specification defining the information elements expected to be present when publishing digitised specimen information at various levels of digitisation. Digital Specimens are online digital representations of their physical counterparts in natural science collections. The definition of digitisation used here is the process of making physical objects digitally available. Levels of digitisation represent a simple categorisation of the type and depth of digitisation achieved by different approaches.

This document contains a list of attributes of each MIDS Information Element, including a documentation name, a specified URI, a recommended English label for user interfaces, a definition, and some ancillary notes.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## 2 Borrowed Vocabulary
When information element names are an exact match to terms in other vocabularies, MIDS uses the URIs, common abbreviations, and namespace prefixes in use in those vocabularies. The URIs are normative, but abbreviations and namespace prefixes have no impact except as an aid to reading the documentation.

Table 1. Vocabularies from which terms have been borrowed (non-normative)

Note: URIs for terms in most of these namespaces do not dereference to anything.  The authoritative documentation can be obtained by clicking on the vocabulary names in the table.
