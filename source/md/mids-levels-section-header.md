The MIDS framework provides a structured approach to assess the digitisation status of specimens, with four progressive levels, each building on the previous one. It was developed with input from the community and reflects real-world digitisation practices, taking into account available resources and time.

MIDS Levels 0 and 1 are generic for all specimens or collection items. In MIDS Level 2 and 3 a distinction is made between biological, geological and palaeontological specimens for the information required.
