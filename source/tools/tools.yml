  - title: "MIDS Checker"
    description: "The MIDS Checker is a web-based tool for calculating MIDS scores on biological datasets uploaded to GBIF. The goal of this tool is to make it easy for anyone to check the current MIDS level of their GBIF dataset without having to download the data themselves or run specialist software on their computer. It uses the GBIF predicate API to quickly calculate MIDS level scores at the dataset level and includes a built-in search function to easily find any dataset on GBIF. It has some limitations with regards to the fields supported by the GBIF API: Not all fields present in GBIF datasets and mapped for MIDS can be accessed this way, so results may not always be fully representative."

  - title: "MIDS Calculator"
    description: "The MIDSCalculator is a Shiny app written in R, which allows users to calculate MIDS scores for each record in a submitted dataset, and explore the results. It supports data presented as Simple Darwin Core, Darwin Core Archives and ABCD Biocase archives (though processing of the latter is quite slow). The app is unfortunately not web-available, so it needs to be run on your local machine. This can be done using an R IDE like RStudio, but a Windows installer built with the Inno Setup framework is also periodically released."
